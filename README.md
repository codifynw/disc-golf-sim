# Disc Golf Shot Simulation

![Disc Golf Shot Simulation](images/golf-shot-demo.png)

A visualization of disc shot physics using three.js.

## Description

This project simulates the trajectory of a golf shot based on the following input parameters:

- club speed (initSpeedMPH)
- club angle of attack (initVerticalAngle)
- club path in-to-out (initHorizontalAngle)
- ball spin (initBackspinRPM)
- ball spin axis tilt (initSpinAngle)

The following physical forces on the ball are modelled:

- gravity
- drag
- lift

The discrete integration method for the physics is currently using _Euler_ integration. A more accurate simulation might use Runge-Kutta or such.

## How to run

Open [index.html](index.html). A shot will be simulated automatically. You can play with the sliders on the input box and click "shoot" to simulate another shot.

## How to run tests

Open [test/spec_runner.html](test/spec_runner.html).

The [test/spec/trackman-data.js](test/spec/trackman-data.js) specs are based on some Trackman data pulled from the web for actual shot trajectories based on similar input variables. A passing set of tests would show trajectories matching the Trackman data for a similar set of input criteria. Currently, they do not pass. :) The physics modelling therefore needs some more work.
